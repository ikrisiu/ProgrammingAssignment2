## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## 
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## m is an inverse matrix, x is the initial matrix for which the 
## inverse is calculated

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inv) m <<- inv
  getinv <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned 
## by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve
## the inverse from the cache.
## x is a list with functions returned from previous function makeCacheMatrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(m)
  m
}
